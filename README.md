👋 Hi, I’m @Consultantsrihari / Venkata Sri Hari
👀 I’m interested in DevOps, cloud computing, automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Kubernetes, Terraform for infrastructure as code, Jenkins for automated pipelines, Docker for containerization, and Ansible for configuration management.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source DevOps projects, CI/CD pipeline automation, and cloud infrastructure setup using AWS and Azure.
